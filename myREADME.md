# WeatherAPI

## Description
This app allows a user to enter the name of any city and get that city's current weather and 5 day forecast diplayed on screen. After submitting a city for search, a button is generated for that city and is disaplyed on screen in a search histoy bar. Although it is simple looking, a lof of effort went into the backend logic for this application. This was my first application that used an api to fetch and return data. I learned a lot about function flow a data handling while building this site. Ultimately, I am very proud of its overall functionality.

## Usage
To use the app, navigate to the search bar, enter any city (should maybe stick to larger cities), click the search button and watch the magic happen. Each city searched will be added to search history automatically.
